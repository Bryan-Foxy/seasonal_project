This repository stems from a personal challenge I set for myself with the new year's resolutions for 2024. I commit to undertaking a project in the fields of Computer Vision, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Telecommunications, and Optimization for each season of the year, meaning one project for winter, one for summer, and so on.

The aim of this initiative is to explore various aspects of these fields throughout the year, putting my skills into practice and tackling diverse challenges. Each project will provide an opportunity to deepen my knowledge and skills while also contributing to the community by sharing my findings and results.

The goal is to leverage these seasonal projects to enhance my understanding of emerging technologies, address practical challenges, and perhaps even devise innovative solutions to real-world problems. By documenting and sharing these projects, I also hope to inspire others to explore these areas and embark on their own exciting projects.
