Today, I updated the checkers environment to add two boxes that will contain information about the game.

- **Box 1**: For general information (Time elapsed, Players, Current player, Rules, Game board size, Round)
- **Box 2**: This box will be more specific, containing details about the game's results and the AI model powering the game. We will track new metrics such as Player 1's time and Player 2's time, pieces remaining on the board, win probability, prediction of remaining rounds to conclude the game, and the player most likely to win.
